This is the first iteration of my Home Assistant IR blaster. I haven't put too much thought into the form factor, mounting options, or aesthetic integration. This can be considered a prototype.

## Want One?
For now, I am not looking to manufacture or sell the blaster, but this project is fully open source, so you can build your own. If you own a soldering iron or hot air station, you should be able to get the boards manufactured in China, order the components, and then assemble it by hand.

I use JLCPCB for manufacturing the boards and LCSC as a parts supplier. If you intend on doing the same, you can use [these Gerber files](./gerbers/JLCPCB.zip) and [this example BOM](./bom/LCSC.csv) to order everything you'd need. The components specified in the example LCSC BOM are suggestions, don't take those as the only option.  
I have yet to try the JLCPCB PCBA service for SMT assembly, so I haven't spent the time on preparing the required files.
