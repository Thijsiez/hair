# hair-02

The goal for the 02 is to not need a USB-to-Serial interface chip like the 01, lowering the total BOM cost. Another benefit of using the newer ESP32-C3 SoC, compared to the ESP8266, is that it uses the open source RISC-V instruction set.  
I'm also looking to explore a different form factor using more easily acquirable 3mm IR LEDs, more akin to a BroadLink IR blaster.
